Taks -> 
Rest API - JSON

GET /api/users -> List all users - Done

GET /api/users/1 -> Get the user with id 1 - Done
GET /api/users/2 -> Get the user with id 2 - Done

POST /api/users -> Create new user 

PATCH /api/users/1 -> Edit user with id 1
PATCH /api/users/2 -> Edit user with id 2

DELETE /api/users/1 -> Delete user with id 1
DELETE /api/users/2 -> Delete user with id 2

SOLUTION -> 
For this project firstly we need data and we did not connect any DB yet, so we use [ mockaroo.com ] for fake data

To make a hybrid server we make our API like this.
1 -> if use makes a get req on /users then we render an HTML page.
2 -> if use makes a get req on /api/users then we send response in JSON format.

Dynamic Path Parameter-
GET api/users/:id
id -> Variable | Dynamic

req.body -> 
Data we send form the frontend is availiable in req.body.
But the express did not know what kind of data is comming from frontend, thats why we use a middleware
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended : false}))
This middleware will put form data in req.body.

Middleware -> 
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
1 -> Execute any code.
2 -> Make changes to the request and the response objects.
3 -> End the request-response cycle.
4 -> Call the next middleware function in the stack.
